# Max's Weather Forecast

## Description

I built this weather app because I wanted a personailzed page to view the weather; and save what I searched conveniently to the same page. With this page, you no longer need to re-type the same areas over and over to check the weather. During this project I learned a lot about APIs and how to target specific data called from them.

## Usage

This app is very easy to use, there is a search bar to enter in a city. After entering the city name, hit search and your 5 day forecast will appear. Additionally, under the search bar, your previous searches will be available to click and re-search.
